# npm install framer-motion

* Import framer motion with  "import {motion} from 'framer-motion'"
* To the element you want to animate add a motion before the element title. example = (motion.div)
* Use animate={{}} property to set rules for the animation that triggers right after the component is rendered.
* animate={} inside it you can use a object that you can declare outside the JSX and call it here if it is too big.
